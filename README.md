# regpy
A small library for creating and plotting regression models.

regpy aims to make it as painless as possible to create and plot regression models. 

Setup
-----
Run `pip install -e .` in the root directory and you should be good to go!

Getting Started
---------------
```py
print("This is a test")
```

Notes
-----
>Some may have still have issues importing this package after installation, to which I would recommend using a virtual environment:

>Install venv using `pip install venv` or `pip3 install venv`

>To create a virtual environment, run `python3 -m venv venv`

>Activate it with `venv/Scripts/activate` (for Windows) or `./venv/Scripts/activate` (for Linux-based)

>Run `pip install -e .` again in the root directory and it should work then. To close the virtual environment just use `deactivate`
